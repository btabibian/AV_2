Cross validation test results showed that best accuracy over validation data set was achieved by using combination of Hu moments and temporal area of the extracted object as features of the motion image and multi-class SVM for classification. Results for using different feature sets are shown in Table \ref{tab:features}, for using different number of principal components are shown in Table \ref{tab:pca} and for using different classifiers in Table \ref{tab:classify}.

\subsubsection*{Discussion}

Because of combination of two different methods at feature extraction level we were able to achieve high accuracy of classification. While individually using Hu moments and temporal area of object gives us only moderate 58.3\% and 54.2\% accuracy respectively, combining both feature extraction methods and then performing PCA on them allows us to classify motion images with very high accuracy of 87.5\%. 

We were able to fine tune other parameters, such as number of principal components used and what type of classifier to use, to further maximise accuracy of classification.

\subsubsection*{Possible improvements}

Only using linear classification solvers was attempted for this assignment. Alternative classification algorithms, such as MLP or RBF networks, could be explored. 

Furthermore, motion history image could be improved. At the moment, every frame of a video clip is weighted the same without regards to its temporal location. However, frames located in the middle of a video clip typically hold largest information content as they are displaying the hand actually showing one of the signs. This could be exploited by giving frames close to the middle of a video clip higher weights than frames close to the beginning or end of the clip.
