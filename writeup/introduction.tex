For the second assignment of Advanced Vision course we implemented a system, which classifies motion images into three categories. Motion images in the dataset represent a hand showing one of three signs in rock-paper-scissors game. 

Solution for this problem was implemented in Python language using \textit{OpenCV} library for processing images and \textit{MLPy} library for classification.
